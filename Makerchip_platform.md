# Makerchip IDE – Introduction and Lab Work

---

## Introduction

Let’s get started with Makerchip IDE.

Makerchip is a browser-based development environment used for digital design and hardware description using TL-Verilog. It allows users to design, simulate, and visualize hardware logic directly in the browser without requiring complex local tool installation.

The platform is widely used for learning modern hardware design methodologies, especially in RISC-V based processor design. It simplifies RTL development by introducing transaction-level abstraction and timing abstraction concepts.

Makerchip provides real-time simulation, waveform visualization, and debugging support, making it an efficient tool for both beginners and advanced hardware designers.

## What is TL-Verilog?

TL-Verilog (Transaction Level Verilog) is an extension of traditional Verilog that simplifies hardware design by allowing designers to focus on logic behavior rather than low-level timing management.

Key features include:

- Automatic pipeline management  
- Timing abstraction  
- Reduced manual register handling  
- Improved code readability  
- Faster hardware prototyping

## Why Makerchip is Used

Makerchip provides several advantages compared to traditional RTL simulation environments:

- Cloud-based IDE (No installation required)  
- Instant simulation feedback  
- Built-in visualization tools  
- Easy debugging support  
- Supports TL-Verilog coding  
- Ideal platform for RISC-V processor learning
