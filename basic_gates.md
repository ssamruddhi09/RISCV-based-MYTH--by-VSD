# Basic Logic Gates — Makerchip / RISC-V Context

## 1. Introduction
This document summarizes the **basic logic gates**, their **functionality**, and corresponding **Verilog representations**. It also maps **operations** with their **Boolean arithmetic**, **Boolean calculations**, and **gate implementations**.

## 4. Notes / Observations
- **Universal gates:** NAND and NOR can implement any logic function.  
- **Verilog syntax:** Matches each gate (e.g., `and`, `or`, `not`, `xor`).  
- **Boolean Arithmetic vs Boolean Calculation:** Arithmetic is symbolic (A + B), calculation is practical (evaluates to 0 or 1).
