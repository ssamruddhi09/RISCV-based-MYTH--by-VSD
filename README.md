# RISC-V MYTH Workshop (VSD)

This repository documents my work from the **RISC-V MYTH Workshop** conducted by **VLSI System Design (VSD)**.  
It includes environment setup, verification steps, and sample program execution using **GitHub Codespaces** and a **Linux desktop (noVNC)**.

---

## Overview

The workshop focuses on:
- Setting up a RISC-V development environment in GitHub Codespaces
- Accessing a cloud-based Linux GUI via noVNC
- Compiling and running sample C programs
- Modifying source code and verifying outputs
